# Kalman Smoother

This is a Kalman Smoother implementation.  
Therfore this implementation uses Matrix transformation model,  
estimation results are stable and accurate even on environment that single-precision single precision floating point matrices is used.  
And what's more, 
It is possible to deal with operations even on a weak CPU like embedded system environment.

# Kalman Smoother

A simple and accurate Kalman Smoother implementation.  
This implementation uses Matrix transformation of model.  
It makes the code stable even for single-precision single precision floating point matrices.  
Therefore,  
it is possible to operate even in a weak CPU like embedded system environment with a weak CPU.
